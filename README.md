While this tool was tested, it's impossible to find all bugs");
<br />
Therefore, I do not provide a warranty on your computer or your saves
<br />
This tool is not guarenteed to work and could *potentially* ruin saves. Back up your saves first!
<br />
Currently not supported features: Transfer in progress run, transfer run history
<br />
The file structure are different for these files and will cause crashes. This is being worked on
<br />
