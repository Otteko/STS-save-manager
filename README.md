Slay the Spire save transfer: PC <-> Mobile. Tested as of 2/9/2021
This is open source software, find me on github at:

While this tool was tested, it's impossible to find all bugs");
Therefore, I do not provide a warranty on your computer or your saves
This tool is not guarenteed to work and could *potentially* ruin saves. Back up your saves first!
Currently not supported features: Transfer in progress run, transfer run history
The file structure are different for these files and will cause crashes. This is being worked on
