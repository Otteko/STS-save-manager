Slay the Spire save transfer: PC <-> Mobile. Tested as of 2/9/2021
<br />
This is open source software, find me on github at:
<br />
https://github.com/Otteko/STS-save-manager
<br />
While this tool was tested, it's impossible to find all bugs");
<br />
Therefore, I do not provide a warranty on your computer or your saves
<br />
This tool is not guarenteed to work and could *potentially* ruin saves. Back up your saves first!
<br />
Currently not supported features: Transfer in progress run, transfer run history
<br />
The file structure are different for these files and will cause crashes. This is being worked on
<br />

Having trouble? Try the following steps:
<br />
1. Make sure phone is plugged in and UNLOCKED, Especially if you are using a passcode.
<br />
2. Make sure your phone is set to MTP or PTP mode. Do NOT use "USB File transfer" even if you have the option
<br />
3. Make sure the Slay the Spire app has been opened once, especially after using 4: Reset phone save game
<br />
4. Make sure the Slay the Spire app is NOT currently running (Open multitasking -> Swipe out application, wait a few moments)
<br />
5. Try a different USB port and different USB cable
<br />
6. Turn off USB debugging and make sure no USB services are taking over the connection (Advanced users)
